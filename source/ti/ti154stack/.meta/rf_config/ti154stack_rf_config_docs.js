const coex = {
    enable: {
        displayName: "RF Coexistence",
        description: "Select coex mode of operation",
        longDescription: `
Enable the use of external pin signaling to communicate with another RF capable
device, for the devices to coexist in the same 2.4GHz frequency band.
The coexistence (coex) feature is a wired signal interface between an IEEE 15.4
device and a Wi-Fi device:

\`\`\`
Coex Secondary          Coex Primary
   Device                  Device
+---------+             +---------+
|IEEE 15.4|   Signals   |  Wi-Fi  |
|         | <----/----> |         |
+---------+      n      +---------+
\`\`\`
The coex interface provides a set of signals based on the supported
Packet Traffic Arbitration (PTA) approach:

* REQUEST: Output signal, indicating a request to perform RF activity.
* PRIORITY: Output signal, time-shared between indicating (1) request priority
and (2) type of RF activity.
* GRANT: Input signal, indicating the response to the request to perform RF
activity.

The available combinations of these signals are defined as _coex modes_.
This option is used to match the interface of the coex master the device
is coexisting with. The following signals are enabled for the different modes:

|Coex Mode       | REQUEST | PRIORITY | GRANT |
|----------------|:-------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| 3-Wire         | x       | x        | x     |
| 2-Wire         | x       |          | x     |

__Default__: Disabled

        displayName: "Default Priority",
        description: `
Priority level used when time-shared PRIORITY signal indicates request
priority
`,
        longDescription: `
This option sets the priority level used by the PRIORITY signal when it
indicates the priority of the coex request. The duration of this priority
level is defined by the __Priority Indication Time__ option. See the
__Coex Mode__ description for more information on what this signal is used for.
`
    },
    assertRequestForRx: {
        displayName: "Assert REQUEST Signal For RX",
        description: "Specify if REQUEST signal is asserted for RX commands",
        longDescription: `
If this option is _disabled_, the IEEE device is configured to not assert the
REQUEST signal (and subsequently disregard any of the other coex signals)
when the scheduled RF activity is an RX command.

Note: If an RX command is chained with a TX command, the REQUEST signal
will be asserted in time for the TX activity and will _remain asserted_
until the end of the command chain, even if the following command is an RX.
